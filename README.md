# NLP-Crypto-Project
Fintech Project- NLP Sentiment Analysis Predictive Power of Crypto Prices

# Project Summary:
Our project aims to examine the relationship between public sentiment indicators and the prices of various cryptocurrencies. We will use data from NewsAPI and Glassnode to fit a predictive model using both the Vader sentiment analyzer and recurrent neural network. We will then evaluate the relative effectiveness of each model and determine whether or not either would be valuable as tool for algorithmic trading.
