# Project Summary:
Our project aims to examine the relationship between public sentiment indicators and the prices of various cryptocurrencies. We will use data from NewsAPI and Glassnode to fit a classification model using both the Vader sentiment analyzer and LSTM recurrent neural network. We will then evaluate the relative effectiveness of each model and determine whether or not either would be valuable as tool for predicting future prices. We will also be creating a dashboard with visualizations of our anaylsis and results.

## Libraries used:
* pandas
* nltk/vader
